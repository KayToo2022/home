                    Welcome to my webpage! My name is Kyle Tu and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at San Jose State University.
                    I want to be a developer as I enjoy working with code and programming. With a broad set of skills, (Java, Python, C++, Javascript, React, and even a bit of MATLAB)
                    I hope that I can make my contribution to the workforce.
                </p>
